Description: Sugar Learning Platform - legacy core functionality
 Sugar Learning Platform promotes collaborative learning through Sugar
 Activities that encourage critical thinking, the heart of a quality
 education.  Designed from the ground up especially for children, Sugar
 offers an alternative to traditional “office-desktop” software.
 .
 This package contains some deprecated yet still widely used base
 modules for Sugar.  Please use python-sugar3 instead where possible.
 .
 To get prettier tracebacks if things break, install ipython.
